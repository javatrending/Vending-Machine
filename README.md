The requirements of this project are as follows:

1. Vending machine inventory is stocked via an input file using File I/O.
2. The vending machine is automatically restocked each time the application runs.
3. When the user selects "Display vending machine" option, they are presented a list of all items in the vending machine with its quantity remaining.
4. When the user selects "Purchase Menu", they are guided through purchase menu: Feed Money, Select Product and Finish Transaction.
5. User will be able to feed money into vending machine, select their desired product and make transaction.
6. All the purchases  must be audited to prevent theft from the vending machine. All the trabsactions are logged into  TransactionLog.txt file.
This was a "capstone" project, synthesizing many concepts we studied, including File I/O, Encapsulation and Object Oriented Programming.
